# Online Coding Platform
  We developed a coding platform web application. Three types of users can benefit
from this application. Coder users can view and solve coding and non-coding questions.
Coders can view the information of the coding and non-coding questions and also view their
previous submissions if they have any. While solving coding questions, coders can specify
their choice of programming language. For non-coding questions, coders can view other
coders' submissions after they have made their own submission. Coders can also participate
in contests and attend interviews. For each contest, users can see the leaderboard. Each
coder has a rating and point. They can increase their points by correctly solving non-coding
and coding questions in contests or outside of contests. Ratings of coders are calculated
according to the average success of their in contests. Company users can also view coding
and non-coding questions. A company can sponsor contests, create interviews and evaluate
the candidates for the interview. While creating an interview, a company can add new coding
and non-coding questions to the interview. They can also specify which users to add as
candidates and give deadlines for each. Editor user types can view and create coding and
non-coding questions. They can also create contests consisting of their created coding and
non-coding questions.
